Red-throated Loon (Gavia stellata), Pacific Loon (G. pacifica), cormorant (Phalacrocorax spp.), Surf Scoter (Melanitta perspicillata), Bonaparte's Gull (Larus philadelphia), terns (Sterna spp.), Pigeon Guillemot (Cepphus columba), Brachyramphus murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus and B. brevirostris), Parakeet Auklet (Cyclorrhynchus psittacula), Tufted Puffin (Fratercula cirrhata), and Horned Puffin (Fratercula corniculata) populations declined by $>$50\%. Most of these are piscivores, feeding on schooling fish. Some non-piscivorous taxa, such as Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus), goldeneyes (Bucephala clangula and islandica), and Black Oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani), have increased in Prince William Sound between 1972 and 1989-1993, although a portion of the population was killed by the T/V Exxon Valdez oil spill. Declines in piscivorous bird populations also have been documented in the Gulf of Alaska, the Bering Sea, and along the California coast in the past two decades and have been coincidental to changes in forage fish species in the North Pacific Ocean. Many of the declines appear to be related to changes in forage fish abundance that occurred during a climatic regime shift in the north Pacific Ocean, although some taxa were also affected by the Exxon Valdez oil spill.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: A shift in ocean climate during the late 1970s triggered a reorganization of community structure in the Gulf of Alaska ecosystem, as evidenced in changing catch composition on long-term (1953 to 1997) small-mesh trawl surveys. Forage species such as pandalid shrimp and capelin declined because of recruitment failure and predation, and populations have not yet recovered. Total trawl catch biomass declined $>$50\% and remained low through the 1980s. In contrast, recruitment of high trophic-level groundfish improved during the 1980s, yielding a $>$250\% increase in catch biomass during the 1990s. This trophic reorganization apparently had negative effects on piscivorous sea birds and marine mammals.},

  abstract = {Pacific salmon have been fished extensively for at least a century and artificial production of Pacific salmon has been a management strategy to improve production for almost as long. Hatchery production is considered important because it is commonly believed that the carrying capacity for salmon in the ocean has remained more or less constant and is underutilized as a consequence of limited production of smolts in fresh water. Since the mid-1960s, there has been an increase in hatchery production, partly as a response to a desire to increase catch and partly because of improved hatchery techniques. Since the late 1970s there has been a dramatic increase in the total Pacific salmon catch. The increases in catch are now known to result from a large-scale shift in the productivity of the sub-arctic Pacific and management and enhancement actions. Environmental indices changed about 1989\textendash{}1990 and may indicate that the productive regime of the 1980s has ended. This would imply that under natural conditions Pacific salmon abundance would decline. There are no clear indications of what to expect in the new regime, but it is apparent that the massive production of artificially reared Pacific salmon would not be necessary in a less productive regime. Of concern is the impact that the large numbers of artificially reared salmon will have on wild salmon stock levels.},

  abstract = {Following the 1989 MV Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS) and subsequent herring population collapse in Alaska's Prince William Sound (PWS), the Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) fishery was closed. In the 25~yr since EVOS, herring and several herring-dependent marine bird species have failed to reach pre-spill population levels. One hypothesis is that intense predation pressure may be inhibiting herring recovery. To inform herring modeling efforts, this study estimated marine bird consumption of juvenile and adult herring in PWS for 10 winters over an 18-yr period (1989\textendash{}90 through 2006\textendash{}2007). Total estimated herring consumption by wintering marine birds averaged 2409~$\pm$~950~t, indicating that avian consumption represents a substantial and inter-annually variable source of herring mortality. Common murre (Uria aalge) consumed the greatest portion (16\textendash{}80\%) of herring in all years among marine bird species. Juvenile herring biomass consumed annually by common murre was greater than murre consumption of adult herring biomass. Time lag analyses showed that marine bird consumption of adult herring is negatively correlated with the amount of herring spawn observed in subsequent years, but such effects were not observed more than 2~yr. Our models indicate that during years in which herring recruitment is low or bird populations are particularly large, marine birds can consume up to 10\% of the annual adult herring biomass. Our results highlight the importance of herring to wintering PWS birds. We propose that future management of herring stocks seeks to reduce negative impacts on marine birds that prey on herring.},

Both of these mechanisms can be attributed to an unusually strong and persistent weather pattern featuring much higher than normal sea level pressure over the waters of interest. This anomaly was the greatest observed in this region since at least the 1980s. The region of warm sea surface temperature anomalies subsequently expanded and reached coastal waters in spring and summer 2014. Impacts on fisheries and regional weather are discussed. It is found that sea surface temperature anomalies in this region affect air temperatures downwind in Washington state.},

  abstract = {The Exxon Valdez oil spill that occurred in Prince William Sound, Alaska, in March of 1989 was the largest crude oil spill in the United States at that time, and it was anticipated to have disastrous effects on the ecology and fisheries of that coastal region. The large pink salmon returns to the sound, a major commercial species in Alaska, were of great concern. The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council, a council of government agencies formed to assess the impact of the spill for recovery purposes, concluded that pink salmon in Prince William Sound were damaged by the oil, based on investigations of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the National Marine Fisheries Service. Agency scientists claimed that the oil increased incubation mortality of pink salmon and those exposed to oil experienced less growth, higher long-term mortality, and reduced reproductive success. This contrasted with data and conclusions of the non-agency scientists led by the University of Idaho researchers that showed no impact of oil on incubating eggs or on juvenile pink salmon in marine waters, and no reduction in egg viability of returning adults. In this article the authors re-examine the evidence and resolve the problems that resulted in the different interpretation of research conducted by agency and non-agency scientists. The resolution has far reaching implications on ascertaining the impacts of marine oil spills.},

  abstract = {The length and weight of Russian sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) returning to the Ozernaya River (Kamchatka) was substantially reduced in years when the ocean abundances of Kamchatkan pink (O. gorbuscha) and sockeye salmon were high. We found that the density-dependent reduction in sockeye growth on a per-capita basis was greater for sockeye than for pink salmon. However, the overall effect of pink salmon abundance on sockeye growth was greater because of the higher numerical abundance of pink salmon. The strongest statistical relationships were found for sockeye from separate age groups; pooled data combining all age classes were statistically insignificant. We estimate that, if pink salmon were absent, the most strongly affected age group of sockeye salmon (2.1 males) would weigh twice as much at maturity than if pink salmon populations from eastern and western Kamchatka were both simultaneously at peak observed abundances. Trophic competition in the ocean between pink and sockeye salmon can therefore have a significant influence on the productivity of sockeye populations for the most strongly affected age groups. These effects are large enough that they should be explicitly considered in the management of salmon populations.},

  abstract = {Five years of field, laboratory, and numerical modelling studies demonstrated ecosystem-level mechanisms influencing the mortality of juvenile pink salmon and Pacific herring. Both species are prey for other fishes, seabirds, and marine mammals in Prince William Sound. We identified critical time-space linkages between the juvenile stages of pink salmon and herring rearing in shallow-water nursery areas and seasonally varying ocean state, the availability of appropriate zooplankton forage, and the kinds and numbers of predators. These relationships defined unique habitat dependencies for juveniles whose survivals were strongly linked to growth rates, energy reserves, and seasonal trophic sheltering from predators. We found that juvenile herring were subject to substantial starvation losses during a winter period of plankton diminishment, and that predation on juvenile pink salmon was closely linked to the availability of alternative prey for fish and bird predators. Our collaborative study further revealed that juvenile pink salmon and age-0 herring exploit very different portions of the annual production cycle. Juvenile pink salmon targeted the cool-water, early spring plankton bloom dominated by diatoms and large calanoid copepods, whereas young-of-the-year juvenile herring were dependent on warmer conditions occurring later in the postbloom summer and fall when zooplankton was composed of smaller calanoids and a diversity of other taxa. The synopsis of our studies presented in this volume speaks to contemporary issues facing investigators of fish ecosystems, including juvenile fishes, and offers new insight into problems of bottom-up and top-down control. In aggregate, our results point to the importance of seeking mechanistic rather than correlative understandings of complex natural systems.},

  abstract = {The main objective of this study was to use scale patterns to compare the early marine growth of the average pink salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha with that of fish from the same year-class that survived to adulthood to gain insight on critical periods for growth and survival. During 2001\textendash{}2004, pink salmon that survived to adulthood were larger and grew faster than the average juvenile throughout the first growing season, indicating that larger, faster-growing juveniles experienced higher survival. Growth rate declined from mid\textendash{}late June to early\textendash{}mid-July for both juveniles at-large and fish that survived to adulthood. The adult survivors then grew at a faster rate than the average juvenile through September. Both the juvenile pink salmon population at-large and all cohorts that survived to adulthood grew at a faster rate during high-survival years than low-survival years from mid\textendash{}late June to mid\textendash{}late August. Greater variability in the growth trajectories of surviving adults was observed during high-survival years, potentially a result of diversified feeding or distribution strategies. This study supports findings that significant size-selective mortality of juvenile pink salmon occurs after the first growing season. Investigating the timing and magnitude of size-selective mortality on juvenile pink salmon during their first growing season is an initial step toward understanding the processes regulating growth and survival.},

  volume = {18},
  issn = {1051-0761},
  abstract = {We present a framework for evaluating the cause of fishery declines by integrating covariates into a fisheries stock assessment model. This allows the evaluation of fisheries' effects vs. natural and other human impacts. The analyses presented are based on integrating ecological science and statistics and form the basis for environmental decision-making advice. Hypothesis tests are described to rank hypotheses and determine the size of a multiple covariate model. We extend recent developments in integrated analysis and use novel methods to produce effect size estimates that are relevant to policy makers and include estimates of uncertainty. Results can be directly applied to evaluate trade-offs among alternative management decisions. The methods and results are also broadly applicable outside fisheries stock assessment. We show that multiple factors influence populations and that analysis of factors in isolation can be misleading. We illustrate the framework by applying it to Pacific herring of Prince William Sound, Alaska (USA). The Pacific herring stock that spawns in Prince William Sound is a stock that has collapsed, but there are several competing or alternative hypotheses to account for the initial collapse and subsequent lack of recovery. Factors failing the initial screening tests for statistical significance included indicators of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, coho salmon predation, sea lion predation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Northern Oscillation Index, and effects of containment in the herring egg-on-kelp pound fishery. The overall results indicate that the most statistically significant factors related to the lack of recovery of the herring stock involve competition or predation by juvenile hatchery pink salmon on herring juveniles. Secondary factors identified in the analysis were poor nutrition in the winter, ocean (Gulf of Alaska) temperature in the winter, the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, and the pathogen Ichthyophonus hoferi. The implication of this result to fisheries management in Prince William Sound is that it may well be difficult to simultaneously increase the production of pink salmon and maintain a viable Pacific herring fishery. The impact can be extended to other commercially important fisheries, and a whole ecosystem approach may be needed to evaluate the costs and benefits of salmon hatcheries.},

  abstract = {We critically review the role of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) in the 1992-1993 collapse of the Prince William Sound (PWS) herring fishery. VHSV was detected in samples of moribund Pacific herring from PWS in spring 1993 when about 63\% of the expected fish failed to appear. A low prevalence and severity of VHSV were observed in adult pre-spawning PWS herring in most of the years from 1994 to 2002. The North American strain of VHSV became established about 500 yr ago in many northeast Pacific marine fish species, including herring. In Alaska, the typical annual prevalence of VHSV in pre-spawning herring ranges from 0 to 17\%. New threshold analysis of a 9 yr study indicates that only about half of the virus-infected adult fish in PWS were clinically affected; ulcers formerly attributed to VHS have been overestimated by a factor of about 3. We conclude that VHSV was not a primary causative factor in the PWS herring population collapse or in its failure to recover. Because older age classes of herring were not disproportionately missing in 1993, the protozoan Ichthyophonus hoferi was also not a likely cause of losses. The 'Exxon Valdez' oil spill occurred in PWS, Alaska, U.S.A., in 1989. Evidence for interaction of oil and VHSV expression is also evaluated. A study exposing herring to varying concentrations of weathered crude oil showed increasing prevalences of VHSV correlated with oil concentration; however, repeated experiments with juvenile and adult fish failed to corroborate these results or link oil to VHSV infection in herring.},

  abstract = {Forage fish support the largest fisheries in the world but also play key roles in marine food webs by transferring energy from plankton to upper trophic-level predators, such as large fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. Fishing can, thereby, have far reaching consequences on marine food webs unless safeguards are in place to avoid depleting forage fish to dangerously low levels, where dependent predators are most vulnerable. However, disentangling the contributions of fishing vs. natural processes on population dynamics has been difficult because of the sensitivity of these stocks to environmental conditions. Here, we overcome this difficulty by collating population time series for forage fish populations that account for nearly two-thirds of global catch of forage fish to identify the fingerprint of fisheries on their population dynamics. Forage fish population collapses shared a set of common and unique characteristics: high fishing pressure for several years before collapse, a sharp drop in natural population productivity, and a lagged response to reduce fishing pressure. Lagged response to natural productivity declines can sharply amplify the magnitude of naturally occurring population fluctuations. Finally, we show that the magnitude and frequency of collapses are greater than expected from natural productivity characteristics and therefore, likely attributed to fishing. The durations of collapses, however, were not different from those expected based on natural productivity shifts. A risk-based management scheme that reduces fishing when populations become scarce would protect forage fish and their predators from collapse with little effect on long-term average catches.},

  abstract = {There are two fundamental ways of doing science: the experimental-predictive and the historical-descriptive. The experimental-predictive approach uses the techniques of controlled experiment, the reduction of natural complexity to a minimal set of general causes, and presupposes that all times can be treated alike and adequately simulated in the laboratory. The historical-descriptive approach uses a mode of analysis which is rooted in the comparative and observational richness of our data, is holistic in its treatment of systems and events, and assumes that the final result being studied is unique, i.e. dependent or contingent upon everything that came before. We suggest that one of the real difficulties we have in understanding ecosystem properties is our inability to deal with scale, and we show how historical science allows us to approach the issue of scale through the interpretation of pattern in time and space. We then use the techniques of the historical-descriptive approach to doing science in the context of our own and other research on climate change and biological production in the North-east Pacific Ocean. In particular, we examine rapid decadal-scale shifts in the abundance and distribution of two major components\textendash{}salmon and zooplankton - of the large marine ecosystem of the North-east Pacific, and how they relate to similar shifts in North Pacific atmosphere and ocean climate. We conclude that they are all related, and that climate-driven regime shifts, such as those we have identified in the North-east Pacific, can cause major reorganizations of ecological relationships over vast oceanic regions.},

A generalized linear model indicated that time of day, date, and time relative to low tide significantly affected seal counts. When Poisson regression was used to adjust counts to a standardized set of survey conditions, results showed a highly significant decline of 4.6\% per year. Unadjusted counts indicated a slight, but not statistically significant, decline in the number of seals. The number of harbor seals on the trend-count route in eastern and central PWS has been declining since at least 1984, with an overall population reduction of 63\% through 1997.

  abstract = {* Ionizing radiation produces oxidative stress, but organisms can adapt to their exposure with physiological adaptive responses. However, the role of radioadaptive responses in wild populations remains poorly known.

* At Chernobyl, studies of birds and other taxa including humans show that chronic exposure to radiation depletes antioxidants and increases oxidative damage. Here, we present analyses of levels of the most important intracellular antioxidant (i.e. glutathione, GSH), its redox status, DNA damage and body condition in 16 species of birds exposed to radiation at Chernobyl. We use an approach that allows considering the individual bird as the sampling unit while controlling for phylogenetic effects, thus increasing the statistical power by avoiding the use of species means as done for most previous comparative studies.

* As a consequence, we found a pattern radically different from previous studies in wild populations, showing that GSH levels and body condition increased, and oxidative stress and DNA damage decreased, with increasing background radiation. Thus, when several species are considered, the overall pattern indicates that birds are not negatively affected by chronic exposure to radiation and may even obtain beneficial hormetic effects following an adaptive response. Analysis of the phylogenetic signal supports the existence of adaptation in the studied traits, particularly in GSH levels and DNA damage.

* We also show that, under equal levels of radiation, the birds that produce larger amounts of the pigment pheomelanin and lower amounts of eumelanin pay a cost in terms of decreased GSH levels, increased oxidative stress and DNA damage, and poorer body condition. Radiation, however, diminished another potential cost of pheomelanin, namely its tendency to produce free radicals when exposed to radiation, because it induced a change towards the production of less pro-oxidant forms of pheomelanin with higher benzothiazole-to-benzothiazine ratios, which may have facilitated the acclimation of birds to radiation exposure.

* Our findings represent the first evidence of adaptation to ionizing radiation in wild animals, and confirm that pheomelanin synthesis represents an evolutionary constraint under stressful environmental conditions because it requires GSH consumption.},

  abstract = {It is now widely accepted that a climatic regime shift transpired in the North Pacific Ocean in the winter of 1976\textendash{}77. This regime shift has had far reaching consequences for the large marine ecosystems of the North Pacific. Despite the strength and scope of the changes initiated by the shift, it was 10\textendash{}15 years before it was fully recognized. Subsequent research has suggested that this event was not unique in the historical record but merely the latest in a succession of climatic regime shifts. In this study, we assembled 100 environmental time series, 31 climatic and 69 biological, to determine if there is evidence for common regime signals in the 1965\textendash{}1997 period of record. Our analysis reproduces previously documented features of the 1977 regime shift, and identifies a further shift in 1989 in some components of the North Pacific ecosystem. The 1989 changes were neither as pervasive as the 1977 changes nor did they signal a simple return to pre-1977 conditions. A notable feature of the 1989 regime shift is the relative clarity that is found in biological records, which contrasts with the relative lack of clear changes expressed by indices of Pacific climate. Thus, the large marine ecosystems of the North Pacific and Bering Sea appear to filter climate variability strongly, and respond nonlinearly to environmental forcing. We conclude that monitoring North Pacific and Bering Sea ecosystems may allow for an earlier identification of regime shifts than is possible from monitoring climate data alone.},

If variations in catch reflect variations in salmon production, then results of our analysis suggest that the spatial and temporal characteristics of this ``inverse'' catch/production pattern are related to climate forcing associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a recurring pattern of pan-Pacific atmosphere-ocean variability. Temporally, both the physical and biological variability are best characterized as alternating 20-to 30-year-long regimes punctuated by abrupt reversals. From 1977 to the early 1990s, ocean conditions have generally favored Alaska stocks and disfavored West Coast stocks. Unfavorable ocean conditions are likely confounding recent management efforts focused on increasing West Coast Pacific salmon production. Recovery of at-risk (threatened and endangered) stocks may await the next reversal of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Managers should continue to limit harvests, improve hatchery practices, and restore freshwater and estuarine habitats to protect these populations during periods of poor ocean productivity.},

An exception to this zoographic pattern occurred among a group of juvenile, age 1+ year Pacific herring from Cordova Harbor, AK in June 2010, which demonstrated an unusually high infection prevalence of 35\%.

  abstract = {Five hatcheries in Prince William Sound, Alaska, release more than 500 million juvenile pink salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha each year, constituting one of the largest salmon hatchery programs in the world. Before the program was initiated in 1974, pink salmon catches were very low, averaging 3 million fish per year between 1951 and 1979. Since 1980 the catch has averaged more than 20 million fish per year. However, catches in three other areas in Alaska with substantial fisheries for pink salmon (southeast Alaska, Kodiak Island, and the southern Alaska Peninsula) also increased equivalently during the same period, and the hatchery production did not become the dominant factor in Prince William Sound until the mid-1980s, long after the wild population had expanded. A hatchery program in the Kodiak area provides useful contrast to the Prince William Sound program because it is smaller and more isolated from the major wild-stock-producing areas of Kodiak Island. The evidence suggests that the hatchery program in Prince William Sound replaced rather than augmented wild production. Two likely causes of the replacement were a decline in wild escapement associated with harvesting hatchery stocks and biological impacts of the hatchery fish on wild fish. Published papers disagree on the impact of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, but none of the estimates would account for more than a 2\% reduction in wild-stock abundance, and the decline in wild stocks began well before the oil spill. No evidence in the Kodiak area program suggests any impact on wild stocks. This analysis suggests that agencies considering the use of hatcheries for augmenting salmonids or other marine species should be aware of the high probability that wild stocks may be adversely affected unless the harvesting of the hatchery fish is isolated from the wild stocks and the hatchery and wild fish do not share habitat during their early ocean life.},

  shorttitle = {{{MARSS}}},
  abstract = {Abstract MARSS is a package for fitting multivariate autoregressive state-space models to time-series data. The MARSS package implements state-space models in a maximum likelihood framework. The core functionality of MARSS is based on likelihood maximization using the Kalman filter/smoother, combined with an EM algorithm. To make comparisons with other packages available, parameter estimation is also permitted via direct search routines available in 'optim'. The MARSS package allows data to contain missing values and allows a wide variety of model structures and constraints to be specified (such as fixed or shared parameters). In addition to model-fitting, the package provides bootstrap routines for simulating data and generating confidence intervals, and multiple options for calculating model selection criteria (such as AIC). The MARSS package (Holmes et al., 2012) is an R package for fitting linear multivariate autoregressive state-space (MARSS) models with Gaussian errors to time-series data. This class of model is extremely important in the study of linear stochastic dynamical systems, and these models are used in many different fields, including economics, engineering, genetics, physics and ecology. The model class has different names in different fields; some common names are dynamic linear models (DLMs) and vector autoregressive (VAR) state-space models. There are a number of existing R packages for fitting this class of models, including sspir (Dethlefsen et al., 2009) for univariate data and dlm},

Data conflicts present difficulties in running integrated assessment models as shown by the age-structured assessment (ASA) model for the Pacific herring population in Prince William Sound (PWS), Alaska. After the 1989 ``Exxon Valdez'' oil spill in PWS, the Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) ASA model indicated a significant decline in the population, starting in winter 1992. Back-calculated estimates from hydroacoustic abundance surveys that started in 1993 suggested that the ASA model overestimated herring biomass from 1990 to 1992 and that the population decline actually began in 1989. To expose data conflicts, we incorporated the hydroacoustic survey information with all available spawning population indices directly into the age-structured model. In this way, the substantial uncertainty about population parameters from 1989 to 1992 attributable to data conflicts was quantified. Consequently, the magnitude of declines for that period estimated from both linear and ASA models depend on the type of integrated datasets and weighting, particularly with indices of male spawners. Our view is that a major decline started in 1992 when disease affected a large population that was in weakened condition. Other views are consistent with the existing data too.},

  abstract = {The 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster exposed embryos of pink salmon and Pacific herring to crude oil in shoreline spawning habitats throughout Prince William Sound, Alaska. The herring fishery collapsed four years later. The role of the spill, if any, in this decline remains one of the most controversial unanswered questions in modern natural resource injury assessment. Crude oil disrupts excitation-contraction coupling in fish heart muscle cells, and we show here that salmon and herring exposed as embryos to trace levels of crude oil grow into juveniles with abnormal hearts and reduced cardiorespiratory function, the latter a key determinant of individual survival and population recruitment. Oil exposure during cardiogenesis led to specific defects in the outflow tract and compact myocardium, and a hypertrophic response in spongy myocardium, evident in juveniles 7 to 9 months after exposure. The thresholds for developmental cardiotoxicity were remarkably low, suggesting the scale of the Exxon Valdez impact in shoreline spawning habitats was much greater than previously appreciated. Moreover, an irreversible loss of cardiac fitness and consequent increases in delayed mortality in oil-exposed cohorts may have been important contributors to the delayed decline of pink salmon and herring stocks in Prince William Sound.},

It has become more common to use stable isotopes to supplement traditional diet studies of salmon in the ocean; however, there have been no integrated syntheses of these data to determine whether stable isotope analyses support the existing conventional wisdom of feeding strategies of the Pacific salmon. We performed a meta-analysis of stable isotope data to examine the extent of trophic partitioning among five species of Pacific salmon during their marine lives. Pink, sockeye, and chum salmon showed very high overlap in resource use and there was no consistent evidence for chum relying on alternative food webs dominated by gelatinous zooplankton. $\delta$15N showed that Chinook and coho salmon fed at trophic levels higher than the other three species. In addition, these two species were distinctly enriched in 13C, suggesting more extensive use of coastal food webs compared to the more depleted (pelagic) signatures of pink, sockeye, and chum salmon. This paper presents the first synthesis of stable isotope work on Pacific salmon and provides $\delta$15N and $\delta$13C values applicable to research on the fate of the marine derived nutrients these organisms transport to freshwater and riparian ecosystems.},

Gonatid squids (mainly Berryteuthis anonychus) were the dominant prey of all salmon species except for chum salmon (O. keta). During the 1997 El Ni{\~n}o event and the 1999 La Ni{\~n}a event, squids decreased sharply in the diets of all Pacific salmon except coho salmon (O. kisutch) in the Subarctic Current, and chum salmon diets changed from gelatinous zooplankton (1995\textendash{}97) to a more diverse array of zooplankton species.

We assessed the ability of leading modes of climate variability [Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), Arctic Oscillation (AO), Pacific-North American Pattern (PNA), North Pacific Index (NPI), El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)] to explain decadal-scale (1965\textendash{}2008) patterns of climatic and biological variability across two North Pacific ecosystems (Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea).

We found that the climate modes alone could not explain ecological variability in the study region. Both linear models (for climate PC1) and generalized additive models (for biology PC1\textendash{}2) invoking only the climate modes produced residuals with significant temporal trends, indicating that the models failed to capture coherent patterns of ecological variability. However, when the residual climate trend and a time series of commercial fishery catches were used as additional candidate variables, resulting models of biology PC1\textendash{}2 satisfied assumptions of independent residuals and out-performed models constructed from the climate modes alone in terms of predictive power. As measured by effect size and Akaike weights, the residual climate trend was the most important variable for explaining biology PC1 variability, and commercial catch the most important variable for biology PC2. Patterns of climate sensitivity and exploitation history for taxa strongly associated with biology PC1\textendash{}2 suggest plausible mechanistic explanations for these modeling results. Our findings suggest that, even in the absence of overfishing and in areas strongly influenced by internal climate variability, climate regime shift effects can only be understood in the context of other ecosystem perturbations.},

  abstract = {The consequences for pelagic communities of warming trends in mid and high latitude ocean regions could be substantial, but their magnitude and trajectory are not yet known. Environmental changes predicted by climate models (and beginning to be confirmed by observations) include warming and freshening of the upper ocean and reduction in the extent and duration of ice cover. One way to evaluate response scenarios is by comparing how ``similar'' zooplankton communities have differed among years and/or locations with differing temperature. The subarctic Pacific is a strong candidate for such comparisons, because the same mix of zooplankton species dominates over a wide range of temperature climatologies, and observations have spanned substantial temperature variability at interannual-to-decadal time scales. In this paper, we review and extend copepod abundance and phenology time series from net tow and Continuous Plankton Recorder surveys in the subarctic Northeast Pacific. The two strongest responses we have observed are latitudinal shifts in centers of abundance of many species (poleward under warm conditions), and changes in the life cycle timing of Neocalanus plumchrus in both oceanic and coastal regions (earlier by several weeks in warm years and at warmer locations). These zooplankton data, plus indices of higher trophic level responses such as reproduction, growth and survival of pelagic fish and seabirds, are all moderately-to-strongly intercorrelated ($\mid$r$\mid$ = 0.25\textendash{}0.8) with indices of local and basin-scale temperature anomalies. A principal components analysis of the normalized anomaly time series from 1979 to 2004 shows that a single ``warm-and-low-productivity'' vs. ``cool-and-high-productivity'' component axis accounts for over half of the variance/covariance. Prior to 1990, the scores for this component were negative (``cool'' and ``productive'') or near zero except positive in the El Ni{\~n}o years 1983 and 1987. The scores were strongly and increasingly positive (``warm'' and ``low productivity'') from 1992 to 1998; negative from 1999 to 2002; and again increasingly positive from 2003-present. We suggest that, in strongly seasonal environments, anomalously high temperature may provide misleading environmental cues that contribute to timing mismatch between life history events and the more-nearly-fixed seasonality of insolation, stratification, and food supply.},

We compared population synchrony in a group of threatened Chinook salmon in the highly impacted Snake River basin (Oregon, Washington, Idaho) to that in the sockeye salmon stock complex of less impact Bristol Bay (Alaska). Over the last 40 years, $>$90\% of populations in the Snake River basin became more synchronized with one another. However, over that period, sockeye populations from Alaska did not exhibit systemic changes in synchrony. Coincident with increasing Snake River population synchrony, there was an increase in hatchery propagation and the number of large dams, potentially homogenizing habitats and populations. A simulation using economic portfolio theory revealed that synchronization of Snake River salmon decreased risk-adjusted portfolio performance (the ratio of portfolio productivity to variance) and decreased benefits of population richness. Improving portfolio performance for exploited species, especially given future environmental change, requires protecting a diverse range of populations and the varied habitats upon which they depend.},

We correlated measures of survival rate in units of log e (recruits/spawner) for 110 stocks of pink salmon O. gorbuscha, chum salmon O. keta, and sockeye salmon O. nerka with regional-scale indices of coastal sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, and upwelling as well as with a large-scale index of ocean climate. We examined correlations by month and at multiple lags spanning the periods of spawning, freshwater residence, and early ocean residence of salmon. Survival rates of all three salmon species were related to ocean temperatures just prior to, during, and after out-migration, which are indicative of the early marine conditions experienced by juvenile salmon. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the early marine period is critical to the survival of juvenile salmon. However, survival rates of sockeye salmon were most strongly correlated with coastal sea surface temperature during freshwater residency (i.e., the winter and spring prior to out-migration). Survival rates of pink salmon were also related to sea surface salinity conditions prior to out-migration. There was no evidence for any relationship between the survival rates of salmon and coastal upwelling conditions. As in previous studies, we found that correlations between the survival rates of pink or sockeye salmon in Alaska and sea surface temperature have opposite signs from correlations for stocks in British Columbia and Washington at most lags and at both regional and large (basinwide) spatial scales. In general, however, the measures of coastal ocean conditions that we examined explain a relatively small proportion of the environmentally induced variability in salmon survival rates.},

Ancillary data include data for winds, freshwater runoff, and satellite-tracked drifters. Prince William Sound is a small inland sea in that it is wide enough to have appreciable horizontal cyclonic circulation. It is also a fjord in that it has basin depths to 700 m but is stilled at 180 m to the open ocean. The general circulation pattern is defined by a portion of the westward flowing Alaska Coastal Current on the Gulf of Alaska shelf that enters Prince William Sound through Hinchinbrook Entrance and transits the sound from east to west before exiting through Montague Strait and rejoining the coastal current. However, there is much variability in this circulation, especially in the transport through Hinchinbrook Entrance. In addition, some of the water entering the sound becomes involved in the cyclonic circulation in the northern sound and so has a longer residence time. The circulation is strongly mediated by seasonal and interannual variations in winds and freshwater runoff as well as by local topography both inside and outside the sound. In winter, the strong cyclonic winds over the Gulf of Alaska cause coastal downwelling and strong flow in the upper layers into Prince William Sound through Hinchinbrook Entrance and out through Montague Strait. In summer, the downwelling ceases, allowing subsurface denser water to rise above the sill and flow into the sound through the bottom layers of Hinchinbrook Entrance. We conclude that the best transport data came from Montague Strait, from which we estimate that $\sim$40\% of the volume of Prince William Sound is flushed in summer (May\textendash{}September). This estimated volume rises to about 200\% in winter (October\textendash{}April).},

M. 2009. Recruitment in a changing environment: the 2000s North Sea herring recruitment failure. \textendash{} ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 272\textendash{}277.Environmentally induced change appears to be impacting the recruitment of North Sea herring (Clupea harengus). Despite simultaneously having a large adult population, historically low exploitation, and Marine Stewardship Council accreditation (implying sustainability), there have been an unprecedented 6 sequential years of poor juvenile production (recruitment). Analysis suggests that the poor recruitment arises during the larval overwintering phase, with recent survival rates greatly reduced. Contemporary warming of the North Sea has caused significant changes in the plankton community, and a recently identified regime shift around 2000 shows close temporal agreement with the reduced larval survival. It is, therefore, possible that we are observing the first consequences of this planktonic change for higher trophic levels. There is no indication of a recovery in recruitment in the short term. Fishing mortality is currently outside the agreed management plan, and forecasts show a high risk of the stock moving outside safe biological limits soon, potentially precipitating another collapse of the stock. However, bringing the realized fishing mortality back in line with the management plan would likely alleviate the problem. This illustrates again that recruitment is influenced by more than just spawning-stock biomass, and that changes in other factors can be of equal, or even greater, importance. In such dynamically changing environments, recent management success does not necessarily guarantee future sustainability.},

  doi = {10.3354/meps210255},
  abstract = {ABSTRACT: The joint effect of multiple initial decisions made about sampling design in evaluation of environmental impacts using observational field assessments influences the ability to detect and accurately estimate responses. The design can dictate in advance whether the study can identify even large impacts that truly exist. Following the {\OE}Exxon Valdez$^1$ oil spill in 1989, 4 separate studies of effects of the spill on the intertidal biota were conducted. Studies overlapped sufficiently in geographic area, shoreline habitat, and biological response variables to permit contrasts showing how the aggregate of multiple design decisions led to differences in conclusions. The SEP (Shoreline Ecology Program) supported by Exxon and the CHIA (Coastal Habitat Injury Assessment) funded by the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council shared a core approach of establishing a stratified random design of site selection. The Exxon-supported GOA (Gulf of Alaska) study and the NOAA (National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration) Hazmat (Hazardous Materials) study both chose to employ subjective choices of fixed sites. Despite many common goals, these 4 studies differed greatly in: (1) sampling effort (area covered per sample quadrat, sample replication within sites, numbers of study sites per category, numbers of samplings, and total areas sampled) and sampling design (philosophy of targeting sampling effort, complete randomization versus matched pair designs, sampling frame, treatment of habitat heterogeneity within sites, interspersion of sites, and control of shoreline treatment and oiling intensity); (2) analytical methodology (analysis of covariance versus paired designs, treatment of subsamples as replicates in F-ratios, logic of inferring recovery, and power calculations); and (3) choice of biological response variables (taxonomic level of analysis, aggregating versus splitting separate communities, and scope of communities and habitats examined). The CHIA and NOAA Hazmat studies of epibiotic responses in sheltered rocky shores of Prince William Sound made several decisions to enhance detection power and produced similar conclusions about large reductions in total biotic cover of intertidal space, Fucus cover, mussel abundance, abundance of the limpet Tectura persona and a balanoid barnacle, and increases in open space and abundance of an opportunistic barnacle, Chthamalus dalli. In contrast, the SEP study of this same habitat and geographic region adopted design choices resulting in lower power of detection in 12 (vs CHIA and vs NOAA Hazmat) of 15 separate decisions (with one tie in each contrast). Accordingly, the SEP study was able to detect declines only in Fucus cover and occasionally in total limpet abundance but not in total epifaunal or mussel or balanoid barnacle abundance and, unlike the results of the other 2 studies, most of the taxa analyzed showed apparent increases rather than decreases from oiling and shoreline treatment. The more powerful GOA and CHIA studies of impacts of oiling in the Gulf of Alaska, where oil grounded 1 to 8 wk later and in more weathered condition than in Prince William Sound, showed more consistent and larger reductions in intertidal biota in the sheltered rocky habitat than did the SEP study of Prince William Sound. Thus, the combined effects of many design decisions that reduced power to detect impacts in the SEP study led to failure to demonstrate large impacts of the spill documented by other studies of the same habitat in the same and the more remote region.},

  abstract = {Very high annual rates of precipitation in the coastal mountains that border the northeast Pacific Ocean produce large fresh water discharges (23000 m3 s-1). This discharge has been ignored previously since it does not enter the ocean in the form of large rivers, but, instead, the water enters by way of numerous small rivers and streams. Thus, it acts as a line source instead of a point source. This coastal discharge contributes at least 40\% of the fresh water that enters the northeast Pacific from the atmosphere. The discharge is comparable to the mean annual discharge of the Mississippi River system. The fresh water creates a cross-shelf density gradient that drives an alongshore baroclinic jet. The width of this jet is less than 25 km with speeds in excess of 100 cm s-1. It extends along the coast from southeast Alaska to at least Kodiak Island. Apparently, the flow is maintained as a narrow current adjacent to the coast by wind stress that causes downwelling conditions here throughout most of the year.},

A more than 300 km alongshore shift (locally westward) of isotherms is suggested. The observations are consistent with a conceptual ocean-atmosphere circulation model that employs coastal freshwater discharge, glacial ablation and wind forcing. Positive regional feedback mechanisms accelerate the discharge and poleward heat flux, leading to even higher temperatures, increased ocean stratification and increased storminess. This warming and ocean freshening will have significant impacts on the atmosphere and marine ecosystems of the Northeast Pacific, Bering Sea, Arctic Ocean and quite possibly global ocean circulation.},

  abstract = {Relatively little is known about fish species interactions in offshore areas of the world's oceans because adequate experimental controls are typically unavailable in such vast areas. However, pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) are numerous and have an alternating-year pattern of abundance that provides a natural experimental control to test for interspecific competition in the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea. Since a number of studies have recently examined pink salmon interactions with other salmon, we reviewed them in an effort to describe patterns of interaction over broad regions of the ocean. Research consistently indicated that pink salmon significantly altered prey abundance of other salmon species (e.g., zooplankton, squid), leading to altered diet, reduced total prey consumption and growth, delayed maturation, and reduced survival, depending on species and locale. Reduced survival was observed in chum salmon (O. keta) and Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) originating from Puget Sound and in Bristol Bay sockeye salmon (O. nerka). Growth of pink salmon was not measurably affected by other salmon species, but their growth was sometimes inversely related to their own abundance. In all marine studies, pink salmon affected other species through exploitation of prey resources rather than interference. Interspecific competition was observed in nearshore and offshore waters of the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea, and one study documented competition between species originating from different continents. Climate change had variable effects on competition. In the North Pacific Ocean, competition was observed before and after the ocean regime shift in 1977 that significantly altered abundances of many marine species, whereas a study in the Pacific Northwest reported a shift from predation- to competition-based mortality in response to the 1982/1983 El Nino. Key traits of pink salmon that influenced competition with other salmonids included great abundance, high consumption rates and rapid growth, degree of diet overlap or consumption of lower trophic level prey, and early migration timing into the ocean. The consistent pattern of findings from multiple regions of the ocean provides evidence that interspecific competition can significantly influence salmon population dynamics and that pink salmon may be the dominant competitor among salmon in marine waters.},

A review of factors limiting recovery of Pacific herring stocks in Canada. \textendash{} ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 1903\textendash{}1913. On the west coast of Canada, Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) supported an intensive reduction fishery from the early 1930s until the collapse of all five major stocks in the late 1960s, which then recovered rapidly following a fishery closure. Despite conservative harvests, abundance has declined again recently, with little evidence of recovery. We investigated the effect of bottom-up forcing by zooplankton abundance, top-down forcing by fish and mammal predators, and the effects of sardine abundance as potential competitors on the natural mortality of the herring stock on the west coast of Vancouver Island. Herring mortality was positively related to Thysanoessa spinifera and southern chaetognaths and negatively to pteropod abundance. Estimated predation on herring decreased significantly during the years 1973\textendash{}2008, with the main consumers changing from fish to mammals. However, the correlation with herring mortality was negative, whereas there was a significant positive relationship with sardine abundance. Population recovery is expected to be facilitated by a combination of factors, including adequate food supply, limited or reduced predation (including fishing), and limited competition particularly for wasp\textendash{}waist systems, where different forage species may occupy similar niches.},

  abstract = {We used a first-order loss-rate kinetic model of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) weathering to evaluate 7767 environmental samples collected for the Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS) for the presence of spilled oil. The model was developed from experiments with gravel coated with crude oil and washed for 6 months. The modeled PAH included the 14 most persistent compounds of 31 analyzed by GC/MS. Parameters include loss-rate constants related to the energy required for PAH to escape from petroleum and a quantitative index of weathering. The model accounts for 91\% of the temporal variability of modeled PAH concentra tions. We compared the discrepancies between measured and model-predicted PAH concentrations of EVOS samples with a probability distribution of these dis crepancies derived from the experimental weathering results. Only 1541 field samples contained sufficient PAH for valid application of the model; three-fourths fit the model at $\alpha$ $\geq$ 0.01 type I error, 9\% fit an alternate model characterized by the absence of weathering, 17\% fit neither model, and a few fit both models. The 1164 total samples that fit the weathering model account for 86\% of the summed PAH concentrations detected in all 7767 samples. We conclude that first-order loss-rate kinetics ac count for the dominant PAH weathering processes in the EVOS and that the rate of weathering is determined mainly by the ratio of surface area to volume of petroleum in the environment.},

Surface oiling was recorded for randomly placed quadrats, which were then excavated and examined for subsurface oil. The cumulative area of beach contaminated by surface or subsurface oil was estimated at 11.3 ha. Surface oil varied little with tide height, but subsurface oil was more prevalent at the middle tide heights. The mass of remaining subsurface oil is conservatively estimated at 55\,600 kg. Analysis of terpanes indicated that over 90\% of the surface oil and all of the subsurface oil was from the Exxon Valdez and that Monterey Formation oil deposited after the 1964 Alaska earthquake accounted for the remaining surface oil. These results indicate that oil from the Exxon Valdez remains by far the largest reservoir of biologically available polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on beaches impacted by the spill and that biota dependent on these beaches risk continued exposure.},

  abstract = {Demographic, functional, or habitat diversity can confer stability on populations via portfolio effects (PEs) that integrate across multiple ecological responses and buffer against environmental impacts. The prevalence of these PEs in aquatic organisms is as yet unknown, and can be difficult to quantify; however, understanding mechanisms that stabilize populations in the face of environmental change is a key concern in ecology. Here, we examine PEs in Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) in Puget Sound (USA) using a 40-year time series of biomass data for 19 distinct spawning population units collected using two survey types. Multivariate auto-regressive state-space models show independent dynamics among spawning subpopulations, suggesting that variation in herring production is partially driven by local effects at spawning grounds or during the earliest life history stages. This independence at the subpopulation level confers a stabilizing effect on the overall Puget Sound spawning stock, with herring being as much as three times more stable in the face of environmental perturbation than a single population unit of the same size. Herring populations within Puget Sound are highly asynchronous but share a common negative growth rate and may be influenced by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The biocomplexity in the herring stock shown here demonstrates that preserving spatial and demographic diversity can increase the stability of this herring population and its availability as a resource for consumers.},

One species in particular, pink salmon, became so numerous by the 1990s that they began to dominate other species of salmon for prey resources and to exert top-down control in the open ocean ecosystem. Information from long-term monitoring of seabirds in the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea reveals that the sphere of influence of pink salmon is much larger than previously known. Seabirds, pink salmon, other species of salmon, and by extension other higher-order predators, are tightly linked ecologically and must be included in international management and conservation policies for sustaining all species that compete for common, finite resource pools. These data further emphasize that the unique 2-y cycle in abundance of pink salmon drives interannual shifts between two alternate states of a complex marine ecosystem.},

Using a historical dataset (1978\textendash{}2009), we constructed the first time series of estimated humpback whale abundance in western PWS that is also one of the longest time series used in analyses of humpback whale mark-recapture data. Photographs from this dataset were used to ``mark'' and re-sight individual animals using the unique pigmentation pattern on the ventral flukes of each whale in a mark-recapture analysis. Specifically, the POPAN implementation of the Jolly-Seber mark-recapture model in program MARK was used. Estimates of probabilities of capture and survival, recruitment parameters, and total abundance over the study were obtained, leading to a time series of abundance estimates. Our results show an increase from 39 (SE = 26) to 194 (SE = 17) whales ($\approx\approx\backslash$approx 500 \%) over the time series. The average annual rate of increase (ROI) was 4.53 \% (95 \% CI 3.28\textendash{}5.79 \%) which is only slightly lower than the 5\textendash{}7 \% ROI estimated for the North Pacific. Trends in the number of whales encountered per unit effort were not consistent with abundance estimates from mark-recapture, showing that sightability changes annually.},

Herring and the "Exxon Valdez" oil spill: an investigation into historical data conflicts. \textendash{} ICES Journal of Marine Science, 65: 44\textendash{}50.It was generally believed that the 1989 ``Exxon Valdez'' oil spill did not cause the collapse of the Prince William Sound Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) population because of a 4-year gap between the spill and the collapse. However, we noted in a previous paper that some data suggested an earlier timing for the herring decline. We examine historical patterns of herring spawn, anomalies in historical fisheries model predictions, changes in predation behaviour of Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), and a decadal database of acoustic measurements of herring biomass. Behaviour of adult herring makes them especially vulnerable to damage from oil spills, something that was either unknown or misunderstood at the time of the spill. We therefore argue that the start of the herring decline was coincident with the oil spill, and that the decline took place over a 5-year period, rather than the single-year collapse previously reported. Although a comprehensive management approach is now in use for herring, the tools were not in place at the time of the oil spill or the subsequent collapse.},

  abstract = {Fresh waters are particularly vulnerable to climate change because (i) many species within these fragmented habitats have limited abilities to disperse as the environment changes; (ii) water temperature and availability are climate-dependent; and (iii) many systems are already exposed to numerous anthropogenic stressors. Most climate change studies to date have focused on individuals or species populations, rather than the higher levels of organization (i.e. communities, food webs, ecosystems). We propose that an understanding of the connections between these different levels, which are all ultimately based on individuals, can help to develop a more coherent theoretical framework based on metabolic scaling, foraging theory and ecological stoichiometry, to predict the ecological consequences of climate change. For instance, individual basal metabolic rate scales with body size (which also constrains food web structure and dynamics) and temperature (which determines many ecosystem processes and key aspects of foraging behaviour). In addition, increasing atmospheric CO2 is predicted to alter molar CNP ratios of detrital inputs, which could lead to profound shifts in the stoichiometry of elemental fluxes between consumers and resources at the base of the food web. The different components of climate change (e.g. temperature, hydrology and atmospheric composition) not only affect multiple levels of biological organization, but they may also interact with the many other stressors to which fresh waters are exposed, and future research needs to address these potentially important synergies.},

Statistical correlation and multivariate clustering methods indicated Pacific herring populations form large-scale groups. Large year classes occur synchronously among several Pacific herring populations. Multivariate cluster analyses of recruitment and weight-at-age data indicated that Bering Sea herring populations are distinct from north-east Pacific Ocean populations. Within the NE Pacific Ocean, there appear to be three groups of herring populations: a British Columbia group, a south-east Alaska coastal group, and an outer Gulf of Alaska group. Jackknife and randomization tests indicate these groups are robust and not the result of random chance. Deviations from observed herring population groups were examined for indications of anthropogenic perturbations. The Prince William Sound herring populations did not show any strong deviations corresponding to the oil spill of 1989. There might not yet be enough data since the spill to detect changes in the recruitment or weight-at-age data since that time, particularly if oil spill effects were concentrated on the early life history stages.},

  abstract = {Our collaborative work focused on understanding the system of mechanisms influencing the mortality of juvenile pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) in Prince William Sound, Alaska. Coordinated field studies, data analysis and numerical modelling projects were used to identify and explain the mechanisms and their roles in juvenile mortality. In particular, project studies addressed the identification of major fish and bird predators consuming juvenile salmon and the evaluation of three hypotheses linking these losses to (i) alternative prey for predators (prey-switching hypothesis); (ii) salmon foraging behaviour (refuge-dispersion hypothesis); and (iii) salmon size and growth (size-refuge hypothesis). Two facultative planktivorous fishes, Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) and walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), probably consumed the most juvenile pink salmon each year, although other gadids were also important. Our prey-switching hypothesis was supported by data indicating that herring and pollock switched to alternative nekton prey, including juvenile salmon, when the biomass of large copepods declined below about 0.2~g~m-3. Model simulations were consistent with these findings, but simulations suggested that a June pteropod bloom also sheltered juvenile salmon from predation. Our refuge-dispersion hypothesis was supported by data indicating a five-fold increase in predation losses of juvenile salmon when salmon dispersed from nearshore habitats as the biomass of large copepods declined. Our size-refuge hypothesis was supported by data indicating that size- and growth-dependent vulnerabilities of salmon to predators were a function of predator and prey sizes and the timing of predation events. Our model simulations offered support for the efficacy of representing ecological processes affecting juvenile fishes as systems of coupled evolution equations representing both spatial distribution and physiological status. Simulations wherein model dimensionality was limited through construction of composite trophic groups reproduced the dominant patterns in salmon survival data. In our study, these composite trophic groups were six key zooplankton taxonomic groups, two categories of adult pelagic fishes, and from six to 12 groups for tagged hatchery-reared juvenile salmon. Model simulations also suggested the importance of salmon density and predator size as important factors modifying the predation process.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Killer whales were photographed in oil after the 1989 `Exxon Valdez' oil spill, but preliminary damage assessments did not definitively link mortalities to the spill and could not evaluate recovery. In this study, photo-identification methods were used to monitor 2 killer whale populations 5 yr prior to and for 16 yr after the spill. One resident pod, the AB Pod, and one transient population, the AT1 Group, suffered losses of 33 and 41\%, respectively, in the year following the spill. Sixteen years after 1989, AB Pod had not recovered to pre-spill numbers. Moreover, its rate of increase was significantly less than that of other resident pods that did not decline at the time of the spill. The AT1 Group, which lost 9 members following the spill, continued to decline and is now listed as depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Although there may be other contributing factors, the loss of AT1 individuals, including reproductive-age females, accelerated the population's trajectory toward extinction. The synchronous losses of unprecedented numbers of killer whales from 2 ecologically and genetically separate groups and the absence of other obvious perturbations strengthens the link between the mortalities and lack of recovery, and the `Exxon Valdez' oil spill.},

  abstract = {Pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) returning to Prince William Sound (PWS), Alaska, have increased to historically high levels of abundance in recent years, but average body size at return has declined. We examined how body size at return of PWS pink salmon was related to 10 biophysical factors, including the scale of hatchery production. We also examined the effect of body size at return on productivity of wild pink salmon in PWS. For the 1975\textendash{}1999 brood years, we found that an index of total abundance of pink salmon in the Gulf of Alaska and sea surface temperature during the year of return best explained the variation in pink salmon body size over time. Body size at return was significantly correlated with productivity of wild pink salmon. We used stepwise-regression to fit a generalized linear version of the Ricker spawner-recruit model to determine if body size would explain significant variation in wild-stock productivity in context with other environmental variation, including hatchery production. The results indicate that variability in wild-stock productivity is primarily driven by density-independent factors in the marine environment, but that body size of wild spawners also significantly affects productivity of wild PWS pink salmon. We conclude that the success of large-scale enhancement increasing the total run in PWS may have contributed to the decline in body size because of density-dependent growth in the Gulf of Alaska. We used a simulation model to estimate the impact of hatchery-induced changes in adult body size on wild-stock production in PWS. We estimated an annual wild-stock yield loss of 1.03 million pink salmon, less than 5\% of the annual hatchery return of 24.2 million adult pink salmon for brood years 1990\textendash{}1999.},

  abstract = {Anecdotal accounts regarding reduced US cropping system diversity have raised concerns about negative impacts of increasingly homogeneous cropping systems. However, formal analyses to document such changes are lacking. Using US Agriculture Census data, which are collected every five years, we quantified crop species diversity from 1978 to 2012, for the contiguous US on a county level basis. We used Shannon diversity indices expressed as effective number of crop species (ENCS) to quantify crop diversity. We then evaluated changes in county-level crop diversity both nationally and for each of the eight Farm Resource Regions developed by the National Agriculture Statistics Service. During the 34 years we considered in our analyses, both national and regional ENCS changed. Nationally, crop diversity was lower in 2012 than in 1978. However, our analyses also revealed interesting trends between and within different Resource Regions. Overall, the Heartland Resource Region had the lowest crop diversity whereas the Fruitful Rim and Northern Crescent had the highest. In contrast to the other Resource Regions, the Mississippi Portal had significantly higher crop diversity in 2012 than in 1978. Also, within regions there were differences between counties in crop diversity. Spatial autocorrelation revealed clustering of low and high ENCS and this trend became stronger over time. These results show that, nationally counties have been clustering into areas of either low diversity or high diversity. Moreover, a significant trend of more counties shifting to lower rather than to higher crop diversity was detected. The clustering and shifting demonstrates a trend toward crop diversity loss and attendant homogenization of agricultural production systems, which could have far-reaching consequences for provision of ecosystem system services associated with agricultural systems as well as food system sustainability.},

  title = {An Evaluation of the Effects of Conservation and Fishery Enhancement Hatcheries on Wild Populations of Salmon},
  volume = {53},
  abstract = {The historical, political and scientific aspects of salmon hatchery programmes designed to enhance fishery production, or to recover endangered populations, are reviewed. We start by pointing out that the establishment of hatcheries has been a political response to societal demands for harvest and conservation; given this social context, we then critically examined the levels of activity, the biological risks, and the economic analysis associated with salmon hatchery programmes. A rigorous analysis of the impacts of hatchery programmes was hindered by the lack of standardized data on release sizes and survival rates at all ecological scales, and since hatchery programme objectives are rarely defined, it was also difficult to measure their effectiveness at meeting release objectives. Debates on the genetic effects of hatchery programmes on wild fish have been dominated by whether correct management practices can reduce negative outcomes, but we noted that there has been an absence of programmatic research approaches addressing this important issue. Competitive interactions between hatchery and wild fish were observed to be complex, but studies researching approaches to reduce these interactions at all ecological scales during the entire salmon life history have been rare, and thus are not typically considered in hatchery management. Harvesting of salmon released from fishery enhancement hatcheries likely impacts vulnerable wild populations; managers have responded to this problem by mass marking hatchery fish, so that fishing effort can be directed towards hatchery populations. However, we noted that the effectiveness of this approach is dependant on accurate marking and production of hatchery fish with high survival rates, and it is not yet clear whether selective fishing will prevent overharvest of wild populations. Finally, research demonstrating disease transmission from hatchery fish to wild populations was observed to be equivocal; evidence in this area has been constrained by the lack of effective approaches to studying the fate of pathogens in the wild. We then reviewed several approaches to studying the economic consequences of hatchery activities intended to inform the social decisions surrounding programmes, but recognized that placing monetary value on conservation efforts or on hatcheries that mitigate cultural groups' loss of historical harvest opportunities may complicate these analyses. We noted that economic issues have rarely been included in decision making on hatchery programmes. We end by identifying existing major knowledge gaps, which, if filled, could contribute towards a fuller understanding of the role that hatchery programmes could play in meeting divergent goals. However, we also recognized that many management recommendations arising from such research may involve trade-offs between different risks, and that decisions about these trade-offs must occur within a social context. Hatcheries have played an important role in sustaining some highly endangered populations, and it is possible that reform of practices will lead to an increase in the number of successful programmes. However, a serious appraisal of the role of hatcheries in meeting broader needs is urgently warranted and should take place at the scientific, but more effectively, at the societal level.},

Surveys of pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), chum (O. keta) and sockeye (O. nerka) salmon in wild salmon spawning locations in Prince William Sound (PWS), Alaska since 1997 show a wide range of hatchery straying. The analysis of thermally marked otoliths collected from carcasses indicate that 0\textendash{}98\% of pink salmon, 0\textendash{}63\% of chum salmon and 0\textendash{}93\% of sockeye salmon in spawning areas are hatchery fish, producing an unknown number of hatchery-wild hybrids. Most spawning locations sampled (77\%) had hatchery pink salmon from three or more hatcheries, and 51\% had annual escapements consisting of more than 10\% hatchery pink salmon during at least one of the years surveyed. An exponential decay model of the percentage of hatchery pink salmon strays with distance from hatcheries indicated that streams throughout PWS contain more than 10\% hatchery pink salmon. The prevalence of hatchery pink salmon strays in streams increased throughout the spawning season, while the prevalence of hatchery chum salmon decreased. The level of hatchery salmon strays in many areas of PWS are beyond all proposed thresholds (2\textendash{}10\%), which confounds wild salmon escapement goals and may harm the productivity, genetic diversity and fitness of wild salmon in this region},

As part of this review, a cost/benefit analysis of the State's enhancement program for salmon was performed with cooperation from the Fisheries Research Enhancement Division of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. The main results are that the additional producer's surplus generated by the pink and sockeye hatchery programs are estimated to be less than the costs of running these programs. Eliminating the entire pink or sockeye salmon programs is estimated to increase net benefits by about 8\% and 6\%, respectively. A 15\% increase in either program is estimated to result in a reduction in net benefits and a 15\% decrease in either program is estimated to result in a slight increase in net benefits. Estimates of the confidence intervals for net benefits suggest that the gains from the elimination of either the pink program or the sockeye program are statistically different from zero. However, changes of plus or minus 15\% of current hatchery production are found not to statistically affect net benefits.},

Large-scale hatchery programs for salmonids in the Pacific Northwest have largely failed to provide the anticipated benefits; rather than benefiting the salmon populations, these programs may pose the greatest single threat to the long-term maintenance of salmonids. Fisheries scientists, by promoting hatchery technology and giving hatchery tours, have misled the public into thinking that hatcheries are necessary and can truly compensate for habitat loss. I argue that hatchery programs that attempt to add additional fish to existing healthy wild stocks are ill advised and highly dangerous.},

Binding credit market constraints and incomplete insurance can reduce investment in activities with high expected profits. We conducted several experiments in northern Ghana in which farmers were randomly assigned to receive cash grants, grants of or opportunities to purchase rainfall index insurance, or a combination of the two. Demand for index insurance is strong, and insurance leads to significantly larger agricultural investment and riskier production choices in agriculture. The binding constraint to farmer investment is uninsured risk: when provided with insurance against the primary catastrophic risk they face, farmers are able to find resources to increase expenditure on their farms. Demand for insurance in subsequent years is strongly increasing with farmer's own receipt of insurance payouts, with the receipt of payouts by others in the farmer's social network, as well as with recent poor rain in their village. Both investment patterns and the demand for index insurance are consistent with the presence of important basis risk associated with the index insurance, with imperfect trust that promised payouts will be delivered, as well as with overweighting recent events.},

  abstract = {Marine ecosystems are characterized by many complex interactions. Fisheries managers face the challenge of maintaining or restoring sustainability for individual living resources which are affected by both ecological and economic interactions with other species, through processes like predation and fishing fleet interactions. These species interactions are further complicated by interactions with habitats that are changing due to both human activities and climate change. Often, fishery management systems designed to promote sustainability of individual resources have few tools or processes that also address interactions between species, fleets, habitat, and climate. Here, we review existing and potential fishery assessment and management information and tools, and we develop a potential framework for addressing interactions in management at the request of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council. The structured framework can be used to first prioritize interactions, second specify key questions regarding high priority interactions, and third tailor appropriate analyses to address them. The primary tools for the initial steps in the framework are risk assessment and Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE). Finally, implemented management would be evaluated to ensure that objectives are being met, or to adjust measures as conditions change. In the final section, we outline an example to illustrate how a structured decision making process within the framework could work.},

  abstract = {Climate change and decadal variability are impacting marine fish and invertebrate species worldwide and these impacts will continue for the foreseeable future. Quantitative approaches have been developed to examine climate impacts on productivity, abundance, and distribution of various marine fish and invertebrate species. However, it is difficult to apply these approaches to large numbers of species owing to the lack of mechanistic understanding sufficient for quantitative analyses, as well as the lack of scientific infrastructure to support these more detailed studies. Vulnerability assessments provide a framework for evaluating climate impacts over a broad range of species with existing information. These methods combine the exposure of a species to a stressor (climate change and decadal variability) and the sensitivity of species to the stressor. These two components are then combined to estimate an overall vulnerability. Quantitative data are used when available, but qualitative information and expert opinion are used when quantitative data is lacking. Here we conduct a climate vulnerability assessment on 82 fish and invertebrate species in the Northeast U.S. Shelf including exploited, forage, and protected species. We define climate vulnerability as the extent to which abundance or productivity of a species in the region could be impacted by climate change and decadal variability. We find that the overall climate vulnerability is high to very high for approximately half the species assessed; diadromous and benthic invertebrate species exhibit the greatest vulnerability. In addition, the majority of species included in the assessment have a high potential for a change in distribution in response to projected changes in climate. Negative effects of climate change are expected for approximately half of the species assessed, but some species are expected to be positively affected (e.g., increase in productivity or move into the region). These results will inform research and management activities related to understanding and adapting marine fisheries management and conservation to climate change and decadal variability.},

  abstract = {Objectives To determine the accuracy of a clinical decision rule (the traffic light system developed by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)) for detecting three common serious bacterial infections (urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and bacteraemia) in young febrile children.
Design Retrospective analysis of data from a two year prospective cohort study
Setting A paediatric emergency department.
Participants 15 781 cases of children under 5 years of age presenting with a febrile illness.
Main outcome measures Clinical features were used to categorise each febrile episodes as low, intermediate, or high probability of serious bacterial infection (green, amber, and red zones of the traffic light system); these results were checked (using standard radiological and microbiological tests) for each of the infections of interest and for any serious bacterial infection.
Results After combination of the intermediate and high risk categories, the NICE traffic light system had a test sensitivity of 85.8\% (95\% confidence interval 83.6\% to 87.7\%) and specificity of 28.5\% (27.8\% to 29.3\%) for the detection of any serious bacterial infection. Of the 1140 cases of serious bacterial infection, 157 (13.8\%) were test negative (in the green zone), and, of these, 108 (68.8\%) were urinary tract infections. Adding urine analysis (leucocyte esterase or nitrite positive), reported in 3653 (23.1\%) episodes, to the traffic light system improved the test performance: sensitivity 92.1\% (89.3\% to 94.1\%), specificity 22.3\% (20.9\% to 23.8\%), and relative positive likelihood ratio 1.10 (1.06 to 1.14).
Conclusion The NICE traffic light system failed to identify a substantial proportion of serious bacterial infections, particularly urinary tract infections. The addition of urine analysis significantly improved test sensitivity, making the traffic light system a more useful triage tool for the detection of serious bacterial infections in young febrile children.},

  abstract = {Rhodes Grass crop is continuously cultivated in coastal area of Salalah and Batinah region of Sultanate of Oman and created a negative impact on agriculture production. The government authority stopped Rhodes grass cultivation in coastal area and encouraged farmers to develop new area at Najed. New irrigation water policy regulations imposed to reduce risk of underground water deficit and insure sustainable fodder production. Due to uncertainty of underground water availability, investors have little data to help in making investment decisions. Under these circumstances this research aims to study performance and sustainability of Rhodes grass cultivation at new developed area. The study applied a stochastic budgeting approach to evaluate proposed incentive strategies under different level of underground water. The stochastic budgeting simulation is done by using @Risk software that allows the representation of risk and uncertainty as probability distributions. Stochastic Efficiency with Respect to a Function (SERF) performed to rank different incentive alternatives for decision makers with different degrees of risk aversion and select the risk-efficient incentive strategies. The study calculated risk premium needs to be paid to a decision maker to justify switch from present location (Salalah) to new proposed area which is equal RO 97 thousand for (Hanfeed) and RO 557 thousand for (Dawkah) location. The breakeven risk aversion coefficients were calculated under different Government supporting incentives. Under lower RAC Salalah, Hanfeet2 and Dawkah2 were the most preferred scenarios respectively, whereas under upper RAC Dawkah2 followed by Hanfeet2 and Salalah were the most preferred scenarios. The results illustrate possible conflicts between risk efficiency and sustainability. Change in water policy with raw material subsidy could improve risk efficiency and encourage investors to sustain fodder crop re-allocation activates at new area at Najed.},

  abstract = {Management strategy evaluation (MSE) involves using simulation to compare the relative effectiveness for achieving management objectives of different combinations of data collection schemes, methods of analysis and subsequent processes leading to management actions. MSE can be used to identify a `best' management strategy among a set of candidate strategies, or to determine how well an existing strategy performs. The ability of MSE to facilitate fisheries management achieving its aims depends on how well uncertainty is represented, and how effectively the results of simulations are summarized and presented to the decision-makers. Key challenges for effective use of MSE therefore include characterizing objectives and uncertainty, assigning plausibility ranks to the trials considered, and working with decision-makers to interpret and implement the results of the MSE. This paper explores how~MSEs are conducted and characterizes current `best practice' guidelines, while also indicating whether and how these best practices were applied to two case-studies: the Bering\textendash{}Chukchi\textendash{}Beaufort Seas bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae) and the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax caerulea; Clupeidae).},

Recent advances in fisheries science could revolutionize management of harvested stocks by evaluating management scenarios in a virtual world by including stakeholders and by assessing its robustness to uncertainty. These advances have been synthesized into a framework, management strategy evaluation (MSE), which has hitherto not been used in terrestrial conservation. We review the potential of MSE to transform terrestrial conservation, emphasizing that the behavior of individual harvesters must be included because harvester compliance with management rules has been a major challenge in conservation. Incorporating resource user decision-making required to make MSEs relevant to terrestrial conservation will also advance fisheries science.},

  abstract = {Estimating diet composition is important for understanding interactions between predators and prey and thus illuminating ecosystem function. The diet of many species, however, is difficult to observe directly. Genetic analysis of fecal material collected in the field is therefore a useful tool for gaining insight into wild animal diets. In this study, we used high-throughput DNA sequencing to quantitatively estimate the diet composition of an endangered population of wild killer whales (Orcinus orca) in their summer range in the Salish Sea. We combined 175 fecal samples collected between May and September from five years between 2006 and 2011 into 13 sample groups. Two known DNA composition control groups were also created. Each group was sequenced at a \textasciitilde{}330bp segment of the 16s gene in the mitochondrial genome using an Illumina MiSeq sequencing system. After several quality controls steps, 4,987,107 individual sequences were aligned to a custom sequence database containing 19 potential fish prey species and the most likely species of each fecal-derived sequence was determined. Based on these alignments, salmonids made up $>$98.6\% of the total sequences and thus of the inferred diet. Of the six salmonid species, Chinook salmon made up 79.5\% of the sequences, followed by coho salmon (15\%). Over all years, a clear pattern emerged with Chinook salmon dominating the estimated diet early in the summer, and coho salmon contributing an average of $>$40\% of the diet in late summer. Sockeye salmon appeared to be occasionally important, at $>$18\% in some sample groups. Non-salmonids were rarely observed. Our results are consistent with earlier results based on surface prey remains, and confirm the importance of Chinook salmon in this population's summer diet.},

  abstract = {Predators are critical components of ecosystems. Globally, conservation efforts have targeted depleted populations of top predators for legal protection, and in many cases, this protection has helped their recoveries. Where the recovery of individual species is the goal, these efforts can be seen as largely successful. From an ecosystem perspective, however, predator recovery can introduce significant new conservation and legal challenges. We highlight three types of conflicts created by a single-species focus: (1) recovering predator populations that increase competition with humans for the same prey, (2) new tradeoffs that emerge when protected predators consume protected prey, and (3) multiple predator populations that compete for the same limited prey. We use two food webs with parallel conservation challenges, the Northeast Pacific Ocean and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, to demonstrate legal/policy conflicts and the policy levers that exist to ameliorate conflicts. In some cases, scientific uncertainty about the ecological interaction hinders progress towards resolving conflicts. In others, available policy options are insufficient. In all cases, management decisions must be made in the face of an unknown future. We suggest a framework that incorporates multispecies science, policy tools, and tradeoff analyses into management.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0004084},
  abstract = {Background Human-predator conflicts are directly or indirectly threatening many species with extinction. Thus, biologists are urged to find simple solutions to complex situations while avoiding unforeseen conservation outcomes. The provision of supplementary food at artificial feeding sites (AFS) is frequently used in the conservation of scavenger bird populations currently suffering from indirect poisoning, although no scientific studies on its effectiveness have been conducted.  Methodology/Principal Findings We used a long-term data set of 95 individually marked birds from the largest European core of the endangered bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus) to test the long-term effects of specific AFS for bearded vultures on their survival rates (by CMR models) and population dynamics (by Monte Carlo simulations) in an area where fatalities derived from illegal poisoning and the use of other toxics like veterinary drugs have increased over the last several years. Our data support the positive relationship between the use of AFS and survival. However, contrary to theoretical predictions (e.g. high and more stable adult survival among long-lived species), the use of AFS increased only survival of pre-adults. Moreover, AFS buffered the effects of illegal poisoning on this age-class, while adult survival decreased over years. Our simulations predicted a maximum value of extinction probability over a time horizon of 50 years. Population projections run with survival rates expected in scenarios without poisoning predicted the situation of least conservation concern, while including only AFS can maintain a large floater surplus that may delay population decline but fails to reduce poisoning risk among adults.  Conclusions/Significance Although AFS are not effective to save bearded vultures from an expected population decline, they delay population extinction and can be a useful tool for prolonging population viability while combating illegal and indirect poisoning. The eradication of different sources of poisoning is of top priority to ensure the long-term viability of this and many other species.},

  abstract = {1.\hspace{0.6em}Supplementary winter feeding of game animals, and particularly deer, is a common practice throughout northern (continental) Europe and parts of North America. Feeding is normally associated with maintaining high densities of animals for hunting, in terms of: (i) maintaining or increasing body weights and condition overwinter; (ii) improving reproductive performance and fertility; (iii) increasing overwinter survival; and (iv) reducing levels of damage caused to agriculture and forestry or the natural heritage. We consider the balance of evidence on the effectiveness of winter feeding of red deer Cervus elaphus in achieving these objectives. Where that evidence is equivocal, we attempt to reconcile apparent contradictions to evaluate the circumstances under which winter feeding may or may not be effective. 2.\hspace{0.6em}In general, feeding of red deer on open range appears to have relatively little effect on body weights or fecundity. Effects on increasing antler size and quality are variable and seem to depend on the degree to which animals may be mineral limited on native range. Effects on survival are similarly ambiguous. It is apparent, however, that to be effective in reducing mortality, any supplementation is required early in the season and not simply when heavy mortalities are already being experienced. If provision of supplementary foods is delayed until animals are perceived already to be in poor condition, such feeding may have little effect. 3.\hspace{0.6em}One of the primary goals of winter feeding in both Europe and the USA has become the prevention of environmental damage, particularly damage to commercial and native forests, while maintaining deer populations at densities suitable for hunting. Again, empirical evidence for effectiveness in this regard is inconclusive, with some studies showing a decrease in damage caused, some showing no effect and others showing a significant increase in local impact. 4.\hspace{0.6em}There are equally a number of problems associated with the provision of supplementary feeds overwinter. Those animals which come to the feeding stations may develop a reliance on the food supplement provided, reducing intake of natural forages to near zero; where feed provided is less than 100\% of daily requirement, such animals may regularly lose, rather than gain condition. Feed provision is also extremely uneven at such feeding stations; dominant stags displace younger stags and hinds from the feed provided until they have themselves finished feeding. Concentrations of high densities of animals around small feed-areas may also increase the risk of infection and lead to development of high parasite burdens. 5.\hspace{0.6em}In an attempt to assess the current status and distribution of supplementary winter feeding in Scotland, a questionnaire was circulated to a number of individual across the country. Results of this survey are summarized and conclusions presented on the likely effectiveness of current feeding practices in achieving their aims.},

  abstract = {Understanding the conditions that force the implementation of management actions and their efficiency is crucial for conservation of endangered species. Wildlife managers are widely and increasingly using food supplementation for such species because the potentially immediate benefits may translate into rapid conservation improvements. Supplementary feeding can also pose risks eventually promoting undesired, unexpected, subtle, or indirect, and often unnoticed, effects that are generally poorly understood. For two decades, intensive food supplementation has been used in attempting to improve the breeding productivity of the Spanish Imperial Eagle, Aquila adalberti, one of the most endangered birds of prey in the world. Here, we examined the impact of this intensive management action on nestling health, including contamination, immunodepression, and acquisition of disease agents derived from supplementation techniques and provisioned food. Contrary to management expectations, we found that fed individuals were often inadvertently ``medicated'' with pharmaceuticals (antibiotics and antiparasitics) contained in supplementary food (domestic rabbits). Individuals fed with medicated rabbits showed a depressed immune system and a high prevalence and richness of pathogens compared with those with no or safe supplementary feeding using non-medicated wild rabbits. A higher presence of antibiotics (fluoroquinolones) was found in sick as opposed to healthy individuals among eaglets with supplementary feeding, which points directly toward a causal effect of these drugs in disease and other health impairments. This study represents a telling example of well-meaning management strategies not based on sound scientific evidence becoming a ``contraindicated'' action with detrimental repercussions undermining possible beneficial effects by increasing the impact of stochastic factors on extinction risk of endangered wildlife.},

  abstract = {The transplantation of fishes has a long history in Western culture, beginning with the Romans, who brought carp (Cyprinus carpio) from the Danube River to Italy (Balon 1975). As Christianity spread throughout Europe, carp entered local fish communities, initially as escapees from monastery ponds. More deliberate colonizations were made in Scandinavia, where the introduction of indigenous salmonids into alpine lakes was apparently a regular practice by the 12th century A.D. (Nilsson 1972). Small-scale introductions continued until the 1840s, when the discovery, in France, of artificial propagation techniques for fish made introductions possible on a much larger scale (Regier and Applegate 1972). The idea of enhancing wild fish populations through the introduction of hatchery-reared fish quickly spread to North America and by the 1870s private, state, and federal fish hatcheries were common. The most important species reared at this time was the carp, which by 1890 was found throughout North America, thanks to the development of railroads and fish transport cars. Other species were raised as well, however, so that by 1873 a railroad car containing 300,000 fish of 10 species was on its way to California (Sheeley 1917). Such cars usually carried Pacific coast salmonids back to the eastern seaboard on the return trip. This practice of taxon redistribution (Regier and Applegate 1972) continues to the present time, not only with fish but with other aquatic organisms as well (e.g., Carlton 1974).},

  abstract = {Artificial propagation is often seen as a way to maintain and increase or augment fish stocks that have suffered from habitat loss and overexploitation. Large-scale hatchery programs for salmonids in the Pacific Northwest have largely failed to provide the anticipated benefits; rather than benefiting the salmon populations, these programs may pose the greatest single threat to the long-term maintenance of salmonids. Fisheries scientists, by promoting hatchery technology and giving hatchery tours, have misled the public into thinking that hatcheries are necessary and can truly compensate for habitat loss. I argue that hatchery programs that attempt to add additional fish to existing healthy wild stocks are ill advised and highly dangerous.},

  abstract = {Resident (fish eating) killer whales (Orcinus orca) in the North Pacific have been the subject of long-term studies in several geographical regions. The current study examines population parameters in the southern Alaska resident population from 1984 to 2010 and develops a population model. The southern Alaska resident population ranges from southeastern Alaska through the Kodiak archipelago and contains over 700 individuals. We follow the life histories of 343 identifiable whales in 10 pods from two clans born before and during the study. Population parameters were comparable to those of the British Columbia northern resident population during the 1970s and 1980s, except that age of maturity was approximately one year earlier. The average annual rate of increase was slightly higher in Alaska (3.5\%) than for the British Columbia northern residents (2.9\%) and probably represents a population at r-max (maximum rate of growth). Reasons for the high growth rate in Alaska could be a recovery following past anthropogenic mortalities, or more likely, a response to increasing salmon returns in recent decades, resulting in an increase in carrying capacity. The slow maturation and low rate of reproductive response makes these whales slow to recover from natural or anthropogenic catastrophes.},

In particular, Pacific salmon are artificially propagated in enormous numbers in order to compensate for numerous human insults to their populations, yet the ecological impacts of this massive hatchery effort are poorly understood. Here we test the hypothesis that massive numbers of hatchery-raised chinook salmon reduce the marine survival of wild Snake River spring chinook, a threatened species in the USA. Based on a unique 25-year time-series, we demonstrated a strong, negative relationship between the survival of chinook salmon and the number of hatchery fish released, particularly during years of poor ocean conditions. Our results suggest that hatchery programmes that produce increasingly higher numbers of fish may hinder the recovery of depleted wild populations.},

  abstract = {Among other foci, recent research on adaptation to climatic variability and change has sought to evaluate the merit of adaptation generally, as well as the suitability of particular adaptations. Additionally, there is a need to better understand the likely uptake of adaptations. For example, diversification is one adaptation that has been identified as a potential farm-level response to climatic variability and change, but its adoption by farmers for this reason is not well understood. This paper serves two purposes. The first is to document the adoption of crop diversification in Canadian prairie agriculture for the period 1994\textendash{}2002, reflect upon its strengths and limitations for managing a variety of risks, including climatic ones, and gauge its likely adoption by producers in response to anticipated climate change. The second purpose is to draw on this case to refine our current understanding of climate change adaptation more generally. Based upon data from over 15 000 operations, it was determined that individual farms have become more specialized in their cropping patterns since 1994, and this trend is unlikely to change in the immediate future, notwithstanding anticipated climate change and the known risk-reducing benefits of crop diversification. More broadly, the analysis suggests that `suitable' and even `possible' climate change adaptations need to be more rigorously assessed in order to understand their wider strengths and limitations.},

In ecology, these arguments have focused on the effects of species diversity on ecosystem stability but have not considered the importance of biologically relevant diversity within individual species. Current rates of population extirpation are probably at least three orders of magnitude higher than species extinction rates, so there is a pressing need to clarify how population and life history diversity affect the performance of individual species in providing important ecosystem services. Here we use five decades of data from Oncorhynchus nerka (sockeye salmon) in Bristol Bay, Alaska, to provide the first quantification of portfolio effects that derive from population and life history diversity in an important and heavily exploited species. Variability in annual Bristol Bay salmon returns is 2.2 times lower than it would be if the system consisted of a single homogenous population rather than the several hundred discrete populations it currently consists of. Furthermore, if it were a single homogeneous population, such increased variability would lead to ten times more frequent fisheries closures. Portfolio effects are also evident in watershed food webs, where they stabilize and extend predator access to salmon resources.

It is shown how the convenient structure of generalized linear models can be carried over to this more general setting by considering the mean and dispersion structure separately. Mean and dispersion submodels are formulated for this, the dependent variable for the dispersion submodel being the deviance components of the mean submodel. The fact that both submodels are essentially generalized linear models themselves is used to derive simple expressions for the likelihood equations and for asymptotic tests. Estimation algorithms are proposed which have good convergence properties. The results apply mainly to the normal, inverse Gaussian and gamma distributions but can be extended to discrete distributions by using quasi-likelihoods.
